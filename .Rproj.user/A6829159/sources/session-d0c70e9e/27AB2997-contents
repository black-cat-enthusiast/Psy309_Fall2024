# Exploring Variability in the DV

*Please submit a single document for practical #4. A .docx file is the preferred format.*

## 1. Connecting covariates to you dependent variable of interest {-}

By this point, you’ve had a chance to develop your ideas around how to measure a construct within your research topic of interest. The simplest thing to do with such information is just to report its properties, like the average grade in a class, or frequencies, like how many people sign up for different classes. These are known as descriptive statistics.

But if we want to go further and understand why the world is the way that it is, we may try to see how things we can measure are linked together. If we are going to observe more than one variable of interest and see how closely linked these variables are, we are beginning to engage association claims, which often involves a *correlational* approach. When one variable is correlated with another variable of interest, we call it a *covariate*.

For your topic of interest, **describe a second construct / covariate that you suspect is linked (either positively or negatively) to your dependent variable of interest**. What is your reasoning for selecting this variable? Is there an obvious reason that it is relevant, or, even better- is it mentioned as being related in the research literature? **In a short paragraph (3-5 sentences), describe:**
  
-	Discuss your idea for why the two variables might be related.
-	Be clear if the proposed relationship is positive or negative, and speculate about the strength.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Figure 1. A reminder about the data patterns that correspond to various correlation coefficients"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/strength.jpg")
```

-	Provide an in-text citation to (at least) one peer-reviewed article that shows that the constructs might be related.
    + If there is no direct evidence or reporting of this relationship, then cite an article that shows that show some sort of peripheral evidence that could support the relationship that you are proposing. 
-	Below the paragraph, provide an APA style reference to the paper that you cited.

## 2. What is already known about these varaibles? {-}

**Write a paragraph or two describing what we know about your proposed DV and covariate**. What direction are the proposed associations? In this section, you should cite at least 2 empirical, peer-reviewed papers that help you to estimate the expected association size, using APA format (minus hanging indents) and including the full references below the paragraph(s). 

Most importantly, we need to get specific about the expect association value. In your brief literature review, please report any measure of association, which will often be a correlation (r) or beta estimate (b), along with some interpretation of the effect size involved. Effect sizes can be described by specific effect size statistics like cohen’s d or partial eta squared, or they could be describe by confidence intervals.

If you cannot find any reports of correlation values in the literature, then you will have to argue from theory about your predicted effect size:

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/effect_size.jpg")
```

Please note that finding correlations >.30 (or < -.30) is rare in a lot of psychology (especially human research; animal studies tend to yield larger effect sizes), so you will need to justify the effect size you expect to find. 

## 3. Power Analysis: what sample size should you use? {-}

Use an online calculator (LINK: https://homepage.univie.ac.at/robin.ristl/samplesize.php?test=correlation) to determine the sample size needed to meet statistical significance at a = 0.05 and beta = 0.8 given the estimated correlation that you derived from your literature search. Explain what values you entered in the calculator, and what number of participants the calculator indicated would be sufficient to detect statistical significance.

***For this portion of the assignment, make sure that you have your code blocks set to `echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE`.*** This will print the code and the result, but not excessive the messages that R sends.

**Simulate** two columns of data using the `rnorm_multi()` function from the `faux` package to represent your DV and covariate. Use the sample size that you determined was required for adequate power. 

**Analyze** the linear relationship between the two variables using both the `cor.test()` function and the `lm()` function. Write two separate statements that highlight the unique information gained from each analysis approach.

## 4. A picture is worth 1000 words... {-}

**Generate** a ggplot (scatterplot) of the data with a linear line of best fit. You can format this graph in any way that you see fit. Feel free to be creative! Every element of this chart can be tweaked to your specifications. Feel free to `Google` how to change specific aesthetics. 

**Save** the ggplot as a high-quality .png image (`dpi = 300`).  

**Call back** the image that you saved to showcase your simulated data in picture form, and add a figure caption to describe the relationship that you have depicted in the chart.!

## 5. Reflect {-}

Write a closing paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing what it is like trying to estimate an association / correlation from the literature. What did you think about creating your first data visualization using R? Were you surprised by the number of participants required to detect your effect with 80% power? Feeling confused about any of these concepts? Is there anything that would have improved your experience doing this assignment?


## Code for Practical #4 {-}

```{r, include=TRUE}
# Set up how the code chunks will print
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, # Show the code
                      warning = FALSE, # Hide the warnings
                      message = FALSE) # Hide the messages

options(scipen=999) # turn off scientific notation

# You must install packages before you can use them.
# You only needd to install once per computer. 

# install.packages(c("faux","tidyverse")) # Remove leading hashtag to run this line! 

# Once the packages are installed, you can load them to your current R session using the library() command 

library(faux)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Generate Data {-}

```{r}
# Set a consistent start point for "random" data generation
# Makes it so the output will be consistent
set.seed(123) # Can be any value. 

# Generate data. Specify the number of rows, number of variables, means for the columns, sd's for the columns, and the correlation between the columns.

data <- rnorm_multi(n = 85, vars = 2, mu = c(65,100), sd = c(10,15), r = -0.3)
```

### Check out the data {-}

```{r}
# Show me the first 6 rows of data: 
head(data)

# Rename the columns to represent your variables 
colnames(data) <- c("Age","IQ")
```

### Check the correlation {-}

```{r}
# Check the correlation between the two columns 
# If you don't like it, play around with the value in set.seed until you are happy. 
cor.test(data$Age,data$IQ)
```

### Compute a simple linear regression {-}

```{r}
res <- lm(IQ ~ Age, data=data)
summary(res)
```


### Code to generate a basic scatterplot: {-}

```{r}
basic <- data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = IQ))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Save a high quality .png image
## Default size is 7 inches x 7 seven inches
ggsave("Figs/scatter_1.png",basic, dpi = 300)

# Call back the high quality image 
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/scatter_1.png")
```

### A fancier, better looking scatterplot: {-}

```{r,fig.cap="ADD A FIGURE CAPTION HERE"}
a <- data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = IQ))+
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.5, colour = "#800020")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour="#800020", fill="#800020")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  labs(
    x = "Age of Participants",
    y = "IQ Score",
    title = "Relationship Between Age and IQ"
  )+
  xlim(30,90)+
  ylim(60,140)

# Save the chart once you're happy with it as a high quality .png image
ggsave("JLB_graph.png",a,height=4,width=4,dpi = 300)

# Add in the high quality image saved above 
knitr::include_graphics("JLB_graph.png")
```

# TA Responsibilities {-}

## Overview {-}

- Anticipated enrollment = 38 students

The assignments build across the term, so it makes the most sense for **each TA to be assigned ~13 students** to assess throughout the term. 

- We will split the two term tests such that each of you grades 1-2 questions across all of the tests. 

## Course Deliverables {-}

### 1. 5x 3% "Practical" assignments {-}

- Each TA marks bi-weekly submissions for ~13 students.
- Practicals are intended to be "bite-sized" pieces of their final paper project.
- Each submission will be graded out of 15 marks.
- A rubric will be provided on Quercus to evaluate the practical submissions. 

### 2. 2x 25% Tests {-}

- Completed on Quercus
- MC will be auto-graded
- Answer keys for SA questions will be provided the day of the test. 

### 3. 5% Poster Presentation {-}

- The purpose of this assignment is to encourage students to complete and understand their analysis for the final project well ahead of the deadline to submit the written report.
- Students will upload a 5-minute video explaining their project and results. 
- Mostly graded for completion, but also offers an opportunity to provide feedback about the interpretations. 

### 3. 20% Paper {-}

- "Capstone" project for this course (12-14 pages all-in)
- You will evaluate the same ~13 students as you have graded all semester. 
- A detailed rubric will be provided on Quercus to evaluate the essays. 

### 4. 10% In-class participation {-}

- No contribution from TAs - Jennet will manage. 

### TA Student contact {-}

- 10 weekly office hours - **Please send Jennet your personal zoom links** 

- Remaining hours allocated to student contact in the DDAH form can be used to field emails. 

- In any situation where students are hostile or you don't know how to respond to them, feel free to forward their correspondences along to me to deal with. *You can count on me to back up your calls!*

## Course Responsibilities {-}

All of your TA responsibilities can be completed virtually. Psy309 will involve two in-class tests that  will be completed on Quercus. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(data)
```

*Note* That there will be late / deferred submissions for all of the assignments.

```{r}
data$Assignment <- as.character(data$Assignment)
data$Assignment <- factor(data$Assignment,levels=unique(data$Assignment))

data$Size <- as.character(data$Size)
data$Size <- factor(data$Size, levels=c("Small","Med","Largest"))

a <- data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Due_Date,y=Assignment,colour=Size,size=Size))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  theme_classic()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = as.character(data$Due_Date),breaks=data$Due_Date)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust=1,hjust=1))+
  labs(
    x="Assignment Due Dates",
    y="PSY 309 Deliverables"
  )+
  guides(size="none")

ggsave("Psy309_deliverables.png",a,height=4,width=5,dpi=300)

knitr::include_graphics("Psy309_deliverables.png")
```



### Reminders {-}

- Practical assignments are due Fridays at 11:59pm.

I will email you a reminder that submissions are available the day after the due date.
